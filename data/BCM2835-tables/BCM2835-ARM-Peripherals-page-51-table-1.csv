"31:27","","Reserved - Write as 0, read as don't care","",""
"26","NO_WIDE_BURSTS","Don t Do wide writes as a 2 beat burst 
This prevents the DMA from issuing wide writes as 2 
beat AXI bursts. This is an inefficient access mode, so 
the default is to use the bursts.","RW","0x0"
"25:21  WAITS","","Add Wait Cycles 
This slows down the DMA throughput by setting the 
number of dummy cycles burnt after each DMA read 
or write operation is completed. 
A value of 0 means that no wait cycles are to be 
added.","RW","0x0"
"20:16","PERMAP","Peripheral Mapping 
Indicates the peripheral number (1-31) whose ready 
signal shall be used to control the rate of the 
transfers, and whose panic signals will be output on 
the DMA AXI bus. Set to 0 for a continuous un-paced 
transfer.","RW","0x0"
"15:12","BURST_LENGTH","Burst Transfer Length 
Indicates the burst length of the DMA transfers. The 
DMA will attempt to transfer data as bursts of this 
number of words. A value of zero will produce a single 
transfer. Bursts are only produced for specific 
conditions, see main text.","RW","0x0"
"11","SRC_IGNORE","Ignore Reads 
1 = Do not perform source reads. In addition, 
destination writes will zero all the write strobes. This 
is used for fast cache fill operations. 
0 = Perform source reads..","RW","0x0"
"10","SRC_DREQ","Control Source Reads with DREQ 
1 = The DREQ selected by PER_MAP will gate the 
source reads. 
0 = DREQ has no effect.","RW","0x0"
"9","SRC_WIDTH","Source Transfer Width 
1 = Use 128-bit source read width. 
0 = Use 32-bit source read width.","RW","0x0"
"8","SRC_INC","Source Address Increment 
1 = Source address increments after each read. The 
address will increment by 4, if S_WIDTH=0 else by 32. 
0 = Source address does not change.","RW","0x0"
