"6","WAITING_FOR_OUTSTANDING_WRITES","DMA is Waiting for the Last Write to be 
Received 
Indicates if the DMA is currently waiting 
for any outstanding writes to be 
received, and is not transferring data. 
1 = DMA channel is waiting.","RO","0x0"
"5","DREQ_STOPS_DMA","DMA Paused by DREQ State 
Indicates if the DMA is currently paused 
and not transferring data due to the 
DREQ being inactive.. 
1 = DMA channel is paused. 
0 = DMA channel is running.","RO","0x0"
"4","PAUSED","DMA Paused State 
Indicates if the DMA is currently paused 
and not transferring data. This will occur 
if: the active bit has been cleared, if the 
DMA is currently executing wait cycles 
or if the debug_pause signal has been 
set by the debug block, or the number of 
outstanding writes has exceeded the 
max count. 
1 = DMA channel is paused. 
0 = DMA channel is running.","RO","0x0"
"3","DREQ","DREQ State 
Indicates the state of the selected DREQ 
(Data Request) signal, ie. the DREQ 
selected by the PERMAP field of the 
transfer info. 
1 = Requesting data. This will only be 
valid once the DMA has started and the 
PERMAP field has been loaded from the 
CB. It will remain valid, indicating the 
selected DREQ signal, until a new CB is 
loaded. If PERMAP is set to zero (un-
paced transfer) then this bit will read 
back as 1. 
0 = No data request.","RO","0x0"
"2","INT","Interrupt Status 
This is set when the transfer for the CB 
ends and INTEN is set to 1. Once set it 
must be manually cleared down, even if 
the next CB has INTEN = 0. 
Write 1 to clear.","W1C","0x0"
