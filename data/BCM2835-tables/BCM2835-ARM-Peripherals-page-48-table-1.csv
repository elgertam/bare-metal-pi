"28","WAIT_FOR_OUTSTANDING_WRITES","Wait for outstanding writes 
When set to 1, the DMA will keep a tally 
of the AXI writes going out and the write 
responses coming in. At the very end of 
the current DMA transfer it will wait 
until the last outstanding write response 
has been received before indicating the 
transfer is complete. Whilst waiting it 
will load the next CB address (but will 
not fetch the CB), clear the active flag (if 
the next CB address = zero), and it will 
defer setting the END flag or the INT flag 
until the last outstanding write response 
has been received. 
In this mode, the DMA will pause if it has 
more than 13 outstanding writes at any 
one time.","RW","0x0"

Indicates if the DMA has detected an
