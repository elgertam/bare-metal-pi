"8","FLIP","Invert the clock generator output 
This is intended for use in test/debug only. Switching 
this control will generate an edge on the clock 
generator output. To avoid output glitches do not 
switch this control while BUSY=1.","R/W","0"
"7","BUSY","Clock generator is running 
Indicates the clock generator is running. To avoid 
glitches and lock-ups, clock sources and setups must 
not be changed while this flag is set.","R","0"

This requests the clock to start or stop without 
glitches. The output clock will not stop immediately 
because the cycle must be allowed to complete to
