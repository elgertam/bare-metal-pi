"3","WAIT_RESP","Wait for a Write Response 
When set this makes the DMA wait until it receives 
the AXI write response for each write. This ensures 
that multiple writes cannot get stacked in the AXI bus 
pipeline.

proceeding.

sent.","RW","0x0"

1 = 2D mode interpret the TXFR_LEN register as

add the strides to the address after each transfer.

1 = Generate an interrupt when the transfer described
