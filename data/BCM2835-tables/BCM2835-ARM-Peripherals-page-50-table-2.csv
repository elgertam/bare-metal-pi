"31:0","SCB_ADDR","Control Block Address 
This tells the DMA where to find a Control Block 
stored in memory. When the ACTIVE bit is set and this 
address is non zero, the DMA will begin its transfer by 
loading the contents of the addressed CB into the 
relevant DMA channel registers. 
At the end of the transfer this register will be updated 
with the ADDR field of the NEXTCONBK control block 
register. If this field is zero, the DMA will stop. 
Reading this register will return the address of the 
currently active CB (in the linked list of CB s). The 
address must be 256 bit aligned, so the bottom 5 bits 
of the address must be zero.","RW","0x0"
