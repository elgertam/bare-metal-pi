"08","TIMER_INCREME
NT","Main timer increment value selection
The main timer (driving the ARM core 'global system
counter') is incremented by this amount each time the
prescaler output is asserted. The ability to set the
increment value to two allows the main timer to count ARM
core clock cycles in the case where the AXI/APB clock
frequency is half of the ARM core clock frequency and the
prescaler ratio is unity.
1 = increment count by two.
0 = increment count by one.","RW","0x0"
"07","PROC_CLK_TIMER Main timer clock selection","The main timer (driving the ARM core 'global system
counter') may be driven either from the fast but variable
AXI/APB bus clock or from the fixed-frequency but slower
crystal reference clock.
1 = select AXI/APB clock.
0 = select crystal clock.","RW","0x0"
"06","AXIERRIRQ_EN","When set to '1', this bit masks the AXI Error interrupt. An
AXI error output is asserted by the ARMâ€™s L2 cache if an
error response is received. If not masked, this causes an
interrupt to be raised. If this bit is set, the interrupt is not
raised.
Interrupt routing for this is controlled by the AXI_ERR_CORE
field in the CORE_IRQ_CONTROL register.","RW","0x0"
