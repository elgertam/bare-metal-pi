"07:04","PMU_FIQ","PMU to FIQ routing mask.
Setting bit N within this four bit field routes the PMUIRQ
output from ARM core N to the FIQ interrupt request on
that ARM core.","W1C","0x0"
"03:00","PMU_IRQ","PMU to IRQ routing mask
Setting bit N within this four bit field routes the PMUIRQ
output from ARM core N to the IRQ interrupt request on
that ARM core. Note that it is not possible to route the PMU
interrupt to both the FIQ and IRQ request pins: setting a bit
in the PMU_FIQ field causes the request to go to the coreâ€™s
FIQ pin only, irrespective of this field.","W1C","0x0"
