"06","MBOX2_FIQ","When set to '1', this bit causes the third mailbox, i.e.
mailbox 4C+2 for ARM core number C, (so mailbox 2 for
ARM core 0, 6 for ARM core 1, etc.) to trigger a FIQ
interrupt when any bit is set in the mailbox.","RW","0x0"
"05","MBOX1_FIQ","When set to '1', this bit causes the second mailbox, i.e.
mailbox 4C+1 for ARM core number C, (so mailbox 1 for
ARM core 0, 5 for ARM core 1, etc.) to trigger a FIQ
interrupt when any bit is set in the mailbox.","RW","0x0"
"04","MBOX0_FIQ","When set to '1', this bit causes the first mailbox, i.e. mailbox
4C for ARM core number C, (so mailbox 0 for ARM core 0, 4
for ARM core 1, etc.) to trigger a FIQ interrupt when any bit
is set in the mailbox.","RW","0x0"
"03","MBOX3_IRQ","When set to '1', this bit causes the fourth mailbox, i.e.
mailbox 4C+3 for ARM core number C, (so mailbox 3 for
ARM core 0, 7 for ARM core 1, etc.) to trigger an IRQ
interrupt when any bit is set in the mailbox. Note that this is
overridden by the corresponding FIQ bit: a particular event
may be routed either to the FIQ or IRQ request pin, not both.
If the FIQ bit is set, then the event will be routed to the FIQ
request pin only, irrespective of the state of this bit.","RW","0x0"
