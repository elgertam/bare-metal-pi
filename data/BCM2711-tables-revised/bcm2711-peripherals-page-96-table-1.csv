"03","CNT_V_IRQ","When set to '1', this bit causes the 'Virtual Timer Event'
output to be routed to the IRQ interrupt request. Note that
this is overridden by the corresponding FIQ bit: a particular

not both. If the FIQ bit is set, then the event will be routed to
the FIQ request pin only, irrespective of the state of this bit.","RW","0x0"
